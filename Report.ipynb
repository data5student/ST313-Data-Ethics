    "Contemporary health research is becoming increasingly reliant on observational studies, moving away from the ‘golden standard’ of using randomised controlled trials (RCT) <a href= \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7989480/\">(Bajwa et al. 2021)</a> . As noted by Bajwa et al. it is not always feasible to conduct an RCT, especially in studies involving long-term dietary and lifestyle behaviours in which researchers need to resort to other experiment designs. These findings carry substantial weight as they shape public behaviour and health policy, as seen from the 1998 Wakefield MMR-autism study, where a single flawed study sparked an international anti-vaccination movement, leading to increases in preventable disease outbreaks (source). (or maybe something to do with surrogate science idk). Whilst some cases involve intentional fraud, even well-intentioned observational research can have misleading results due to choices in the method, causal assumptions, problems with the data, etc.\n",
