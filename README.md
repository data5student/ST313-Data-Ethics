<b> Title: </b> Evaluating Causal Assumptions and Ethical Transparency in Observational Health Research Papers

<b> Topic: </b> Discussing ethical challenges in using large national health datasets and creating models to determine causal relationships, specifically by evaluating claims from the paper: 

  “Exploring the impact of coffee consumption and caffeine intake on cognitive performance in older     adults: a comprehensive analysis using NHANES data and gene correlation analysis”, 

about the relationship between coffee consumption and cognitive performance using NHANES data in the US.

This repository contains the code that supplements the main report. All the code is self-contained within the DATA notebook and the SUPPORTING CODE. The main report only contains examples, excerpts, and the final results from the code. 

DATA -- Has loading, cleaning, variable construction, and all preprocessing decisions.
SUPPORTING CODE - Includes extended model specifications, the models, and the counterfactual effect calculations. 

Our main analysis was done using R (via rpy2) but we use Python for data cleaning. 

The report itself is sufficient for understanding, however further explanations and details for transparency have been included as references in the DATA and SUPPORTING CODE documents.
